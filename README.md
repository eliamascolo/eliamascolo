### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do research as a PhD student in the [Erill Lab](https://erilllab.umbc.edu/), where I study the evolution of transcriptional gene regulatory systems.

#### Current projects:

I'm developing methods to detect cross-regulations between chromosomal genes and mobile genetic elements &rarr [MGE-TF project](https://github.com/ErillLab/MGE_TF).

We have shown that such cross-regulation can be implemented by some viruses to *hack* the gene network of the host they infect ([Mascolo *et al.* 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.918015/full)), via computational analyses &rarr [LPEG phages project](https://github.com/ErillLab/LPEG_phages)

We are also developing new models of transcriptional regulations that can capture the role of variable spacers in DNA binding motifs (due to flexible components), as well as DNA shape features.
The algorithm we are developing can learn complex DNA patterns in the data via *genetic programming* &rarr [MDGP project](https://github.com/ErillLab/MD_GP)
