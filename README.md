### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do research as a PhD student in the [Erill Lab](https://erilllab.umbc.edu/), where I study the evolution of gene regulatory networks.

#### Current projects:

I'm developing methods to detect transcriptional cross-regulations between chromosomal genes and mobile genetic elements **&rarr;** [MGE-TF project](https://github.com/ErillLab/MGE_TF).

We have shown that some viruses evolve such cross-regulations to *hack* the gene network of the host they infect ([Mascolo *et al.* 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.918015/full)), via computational prediction and experimental validation **&rarr;** [LPEG phages project](https://github.com/ErillLab/LPEG_phages)

We are also developing new models of transcriptional regulation that can capture the role of variable spacers in DNA binding motifs (due to flexible components), as well as DNA shape features.
The software we are developing can learn complex DNA patterns from the data (promoters of known target genes) via a *genetic programming* algorithm **&rarr;** [MDGP project](https://github.com/ErillLab/MD_GP)
